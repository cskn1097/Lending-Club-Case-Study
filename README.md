## General Information
* You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

* The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Conclusions
1. Loans with higher interest rate are having more defaulters. Backgroud verificaiton has to be throughly as a deciding factor before lending the loan
2. Lower graded loans has more defaulters which shows the grading system is one of the important deciding factor for lending loans, lower graded loans should be handled with more verification.
3. CA state applicants should have addition verification as the tendency to default is higher. This is also for other states where defaulting of loans are high.
4. People with past history of bankruptcy must be handled with more verification
5. High Debt to Income ratio leads to Defaulting, this ratio must be verified for high risky applicants
6. Credit hungry applicants(>5 enquiry in last 6months) should be verified with additional documents.
7. small businesses loans has more defaulters, business loans should be validated through with the business plan and profitability
